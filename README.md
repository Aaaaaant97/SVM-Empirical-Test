# Codes Used in MATH 5472 Final Report

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating key properties and advantages of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, focusing on their performance in high-dimensional spaces, the power of the kernel trick, and the mathematical robustness of their solution.

---

## 1. `high_dimension.py`

* **Section 3.1: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality**
* This script showcases the exceptional performance of **Linear SVM** when applied to high-dimensional datasets with a limited number of samples.

## 2. `kernal.py`

* **Section 3.2: The Kernel Revolution**
* This script highlights the fundamental property of **Kernel SVM** to handle non-linear classification problems.

## 3. `global_optimality.py`

* **Section 3.3: Global Optimality and Robustness**
* This script focuses on the mathematical guarantee of the SVM optimization problem. It demonstrates that the solution is globally optimal and unique because the problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem.

## 4. `robustness.py`

* **Section 3.3: Global Optimality and Robustness**
* This script explores the robustness characteristic of SVM.
